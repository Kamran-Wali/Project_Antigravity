"22  Beginning with the 2003 CPS ASEC, respondents were allowed to choose one or more races.  White alone refers to people who reported White and did not report any other race category.  The use of this single-race population does not imply that it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing the data.  The Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Information on people who reported more than one race, such as White and American Indian and Alaska Native or Asian and Black or African American, is available from the 2010 Census through American FactFinder.  About 2.9 percent of people reported more than one race in the 2010 Census.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Being Hispanic was reported by 15.0 percent of White householders who reported only one race, 4.3 percent of Black householders who reported only one race, and 2.4 percent of Asian householders who reported only one race. Data users should exercise caution when interpreting aggregate results for the Hispanic population and for race groups because  these populations consist of many distinct groups that differ in socioeconomic characteristics, culture, and recency of immigration. Data were first collected for Hispanics in 1972.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
